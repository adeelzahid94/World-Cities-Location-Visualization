# World-Cities-Location-Visualization
### Visualizing cities of the world on a map using their geographical location

- I read cities geographical location from "world_cities.txt" file in which each line describes a world city.

- I store the information about each city in its own object within a list, sort the list using quicksort, write the results out to a file, and display part of the output file in a visualization on a world map.

- The input file world_cities.txt consists of 47,913 lines. Each line has information about a world city specifically city's name, population, latitude, and longitude, separated by commas. For example:

  > co,San Diego,10,8014,10.3375,-73.1825

Note: Recommended to run this code in Jupyter notebook for animation to work properly
